# Quick AWS Compliance Checks

## Introduction
This project aims to enhance cloud security by performing compliance checks in AWS environments, addressing key risks identified in [Datadog's State of Cloud Security report](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-cloud-security/).

## Features
- **Long-lived Credentials Check**: Identifies and reports on static, non-expiring credentials, a major cause of cloud security breaches【[”](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-cloud-security/#1)】.
- **Public Access Block Checks**: Monitors public access settings in cloud storage services to prevent data leakage【[”](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-cloud-security/#4)】.
- **MFA Enforcement Verification**: Ensures Multi-Factor Authentication is enforced for cloud access, crucial for preventing account takeovers【[”](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-cloud-security/#2)】.
- **VMs Internet Exposure Audit**: Assesses the exposure of virtual machines to the public internet to mitigate the risk of attacks【[”](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-cloud-security/#6)】.
- **IMDSv2 Enforcement**: Validates the enforcement of Instance Metadata Service V2 (IMDSv2) to protect against server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks【[”](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-cloud-security/#3)】.
